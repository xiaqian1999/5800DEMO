## System Functions
The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [ ] User can enter or filter the date they want to attend for events
* [ ] User can search through keyword or filter by categories to choose the events they want to attend
* [ ] User will received list of events on the given dates
* [ ] User will be notified the numbers of events hosted on each day

## Idea Explaniation
It is a web-app that tends to organize only tech events for students, so the events been filtered will just be student focused.
User are able to choose the events they want to participate in according to different categories by filter or search through keyword. The different category as been shown on the ppt, which includes gender, so like female-only hackathon, and other categories like workshop, job posting either internship or full time entry level position, career fairs, tech-talk, hackathon, resources could be how several companies are hosting project based competition with price rewards or fellowship opportunity. And the basic platform looking will be a calendar looking page that shows the events on the specific date, after user click on the date, they could filter to sign up event by their choice.

## Idea Formation
This idea is originally form during my last semester, when I was junior and trying to find job opportunities and platform that I could learn more tech related knowledges. So here are few well known sites that I find which includes a lot of tech events related information, like meet up for different workshops. So as you could see, since each sites are providing some useful information and events that I want to attend, so I have to subscribe all of their weekly newsletter so I could get the information as soon as possible. But understanding that I don’t only subscribe these sites, there are lots of small sites where they also provides helpful contents. Example like CodePath, break through tech or general CUNY technology weekly newsletters.
